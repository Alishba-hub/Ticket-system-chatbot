Technical support knowledge base:
- If the app crashes, try restarting it as a first troubleshooting step.
- Always ensure your device is connected to a stable internet connection before performing technical actions.
- Clearing the app or browser cache often resolves UI-related issues such as buttons not working or display glitches.
- For API errors, refer to the official developer documentation for error codes and troubleshooting guidance.
- Support agents should not advise on undocumented or experimental features.
- Do not suggest reinstalling the app unless it's the final option after basic steps have failed.
- Never ask users to modify core files or perform root-level actions on their device.
- Use clear, step-by-step instructions when describing technical fixes.
- If the issue involves user data loss or privacy, escalate to the technical investigation team.
